#Session Title: One of the below#
Run the same build and deploy process everywhere
Debuggable builds
Build quality in to automation code
Automation vs Orchestration 

#Brief Synopsis (c. 100 words):#
To provide attendees with thoughts, ideas and proven examples of the benefits of separating the automation and orchestration concerns in software delivery. More specifically how applying this approach and making the build and deploy process a first class citizen can benefit the whole product and team.

#Talk Details:##

##Set the scene##
*Timing - 0-3 mins*
*Purpose:* Explain who I am, what this talk is about and what I mean by the terms build and deploy, automation and orchestration, i.e. a more personal synopsis

* Intro: I'm Lloyd, I'm a freelance software engineer, I believe in #DevOps principles and strive to Continuously Deliver everything (even this talk..see https://github.com/Pipeline2016/README.MD). I've worked in many sectors including manufacturing, consultancy and eCommerce, in support, operational, development and more recently (last 7+ years) in a release/build/devops/consultancy capacity. 

* Build: The Commit phase of a common deployment pipeline, e.g. version, compilation, unit test and package for deployment later on.

* Deploy: Everything onwards of the Commit phase, i.e. automated and manual Acceptance, UAT and Live release.

* Automation vs Orchestration: I believe these are separate concerns, the area between the two is often blurred with much of the automation logic often creeping in to the orchestration process. 

* Containerization: Specifics of this are out of the scope of this talk, however examples of this principle applied to containers can be found here: [TODO]() 



##Fail even earlier and debug locally##
*Timing - 4-8 mins*
*Purpose:* 
   
##Make the build process a first class citizen##
*Timing - 9-17 mins*
*Purpose:* Put the build process under version control and treat it as code, I care about changes and versionsâ€¦ A  LOT
* This is a well known and solved problem
* No need to re-invent the wheel for every product/component
* Consistency, use convention over configuration

##Improve quality##
*Timing - 18-22 mins*
*Purpose:* 

##Summary##
*Timing - 23-25 mins*

*Purpose:* To summarise what we have talked about, the key points to takeaway, links to resources and where we could improve.

* Summary
	* Who did that? 
		Lloyd Holman @lloydholman
	* What happened? 
		I shared the perceived benefits and advantages from treating your build and automation code and processes in the same way as your product code base, i.e as a first class citizen. 
	* Where did it take place?
		Pipeline Conf 2016
	* When did it take place?
		March 2016
	* Why did that happen?

###Talk notes###
* Agile: I believe in the agile manifesto and many of the Scrum/Kanban/Xanban/XP principles and applying them to ones organisation. That said, the single most important point, I believe, is an organisations culture being truly agile, actively encouraging early failure, efficiency and striving to reduce release batch sizes and time frames, this is key for enabling Continuous Delivery. 

* Continuous Delivery:  The CXX test, always be capable of deploying. Strong Continuous Integration (CI) with visible notifications and high quality output tested automatically. Deployment automation and configuration management governance. Fail ideas early, get to market before the competition and realise Return on Investment (RoI) quickly. Make code (app or infrastructure) packaged, integrated and deployable from the first committed line.

* What else can this approach enable during build or deploy phase?
	* Living documentation generation (PDF's from wiki)
	* Reporting on build
	* Change interrogation, feed in to deployment process?
