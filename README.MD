#Session Title: One of the below#
Run the same build and deploy process everywhere
Debuggable builds
Build quality in to automation code

#Brief Synopsis (c. 100 words):#
To provide attendees with ideas and examples of making the build process a first class citizen, how this can benefit the whole product team and why we often cut corners.

#Talk Details:##

##Set the scene##
*Timing - 0-3 mins*
*Purpose:* Explain who I am, what this talk is about and what I understand by the terms build, Continuous Delivery (CD) and Agile principles i.e. a more personal synopsis

* Intro: I'm Lloyd, I'm a freelance software engineer, I believe in #DevOps principles and strive to Continuously Deliver everything (even this talk..see https://github.com/Pipeline2016/README.MD). I've worked in many sectors including manufacturing, consultancy and eCommerce, in support, operational, development and more recently (last 7+ years) in a release/build/devops/consultancy capacity. 

* Build: The Commit phase of a common deployment pipeline, e.g. version, compilation (I often work in .NET environments), unit test and package for deployment later on.

* Containerization: Specifics of this are out of the scope of this talk, however examples of this principle applied to containers can be found here: [TODO]() 

* Continuous Delivery:  The CXX test, always be capable of deploying. Strong Continuous Integration (CI) with visible notifications and high quality output tested automatically. Deployment automation and configuration management governance. Fail ideas early, get to market before the competition and realise Return on Investment (RoI) quickly. Make code (app or infrastructure) packaged, integrated and deployable from the first committed line.

* Agile: I believe in the agile manifesto and many of the Scrum/Kanban/Xanban/XP principles and applying them to ones organisation. That said, the single most important point, I believe, is an organisations culture being truly agile, actively encouraging early failure, efficiency and striving to reduce release batch sizes and time frames, this is key for enabling Continuous Delivery. 

##Fail even earlier and debug locally##

##Improve quality##
*Timing - 18-22 mins*
*Purpose:* 

##Summary##
*Timing - 23-25 mins*

*Purpose:* To summarise what we have talked about, the key points to takeaway, links to resources and where we could improve.

* Summary
	* Who did that? 
		Lloyd Holman @lloydholman
	* What happened? 
		I shared the perceived benefits and advantages from treating your build and automation code and processes in the same way as your product code base, i.e as a first class citizen. 
	* Where did it take place?
		Pipeline Conf 2016
	* When did it take place?
		March 2016
	* Why did that happen?
